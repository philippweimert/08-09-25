The AI engineer iteratively executed a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul of the ACENCIA website, moving from an initial from 0 to 1 state to a fully Apple-like redesign. The process was highly responsive to detailed user feedback, addressing issues from incorrect content restoration to routing errors. Key challenges included consistently applying complex design guidelines across diverse pages, managing specific content preservation (e.g., Hero section text, video functionality), and resolving technical issues like duplicate imports and defunct routes after file deletions. The trajectory demonstrates a systematic, page-by-page transformation, starting with the homepage and extending to all primary and secondary pages, culminating in a complete and verified aesthetic and functional update.

- **Buttons:** Primary (solid accent color), Secondary (1px outline), Tertiary (text link with arrow), consistent padding/radius (8px), 2px focus ring.
- **Forms/Borders/Shadows:** Consistent 8px radii (12px for large Hero cards), 1px hairline borders (gray 200-300) instead of strong shadows, soft/low shadows if needed.
