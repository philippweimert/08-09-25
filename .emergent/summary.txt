The AI engineer's work trajectory involved a significant dual-phase UI/UX transformation of the ACENCIA website. Initially, the application was redesigned from its MVP state to an Apple-like aesthetic, characterized by clean layouts, specific typography, and a white theme. This phase involved systematically applying design principles across all primary and secondary pages, meticulously retaining original content and functionality.

Mid-development, the user introduced a new, urgent requirement: a complete shift to a Corporate Dark Theme (#001F3C background, white text, orange accents, white cards) with specific fonts (Tenor Sans for headlines, Open Sans for body). The AI engineer efficiently adapted, starting with a successful, verified transformation of the homepage. Subsequently, all bAV, bKV, bUV, and standard pages (Imprint, Privacy, About, Contact, Service Team, Aktuelles, Employer Obligations) were systematically converted to this new dark theme.

Concurrently, there was a detailed discussion and planning phase for migrating from a local MongoDB to MongoDB Atlas and preparing for Render deployment, including environment variables and . However, this database task was paused due to the higher priority of the design overhaul. The most recent user request is to integrate dynamic hexagon background patterns into the homepage sections.

The overall objective is a modern, interactive  website. Initially, the design emphasized an Apple-like aesthetic: calm, reduced, clear hierarchy, professional, with a max-width of 1200-1280px, a 12-column grid, specific typography (H1: 56/36px, H2: 40/28px, H3: 28/22px, Body: 16px, Meta: 14px), a slim sticky header, redesigned hero section, refined service boxes, animated Google Reviews, and consistent buttons/forms. Video integration was also specified for the homepage, navigating to the bAV page with autoplay and completion overlay.

Subsequently, the design shifted to a Corporate Dark Theme:
- **Primary Background:** #001F3C (dark corporate blue) for all pages and sub-pages.
- **Typography:** Headlines: Tenor Sans, Body/UI: Open Sans. Text color must be white (or light blue for subtitles), except for white cards.
- **Accent Color:** Orange (#fa9939) for buttons and highlights.
- **Cards/Boxes:** White backgrounds for optimal contrast against the dark background.
- **Layout:** Remaining design elements (e.g., button styles, border radii) should be intelligently integrated with the new color scheme.
- **Animated Hexagon Backgrounds:** Add hexagon patterns to homepage sections, alternating left and right.
This theme must be applied consistently across all pages: Homepage, bAV, bKV, bUV, Imprint, Privacy, About, Contact, Service Team, Aktuelles, Employer Obligations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in the comprehensive implementation of a Corporate Dark Theme across the entire ACENCIA website, as explicitly requested by the user. This involved changing the primary background to #001F3C, ensuring all text is white (or light blue for subtitles), using Tenor Sans for headlines and Open Sans for body text, and making sure cards/boxes are white with orange accents for CTAs.

The implementation proceeded systematically:
1.  **Homepage Transformation**: The  and its integrated components (, , , ) were fully converted to the dark theme and verified via screenshots.
2.  **Core Business Pages**: All pages related to bAV (, , ), bKV (, ), and bUV (, ) were successfully transformed to the dark theme.
3.  **Standard Pages**: All remaining informational and contact pages, including , , , , , , and , were also converted to the dark theme, ensuring site-wide consistency.
4.  **Documentation**: A  file was created to document the new design specifications.

The entire website has now been visually transformed to the dark corporate theme. The most recent explicit request from the user is to integrate hexagon background patterns into the homepage sections, alternating their position (left/right).
